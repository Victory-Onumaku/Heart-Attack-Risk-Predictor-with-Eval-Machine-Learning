The aim of this project is to predict whether a person is having a risk of heart attack or not, using automated machine learning techniques. <br>

# What is a heart attack? <br>
A heart occurs when one or more of coronary arteries becomes blocked. Overtime, a build up of fatty deposits, including cholesterol for substances called plaques, which can narrow the arteries. This condition, called coronary artery disease, causes most heart attacks. <br>  

# Understanding the problem statement. <br>
A dataset is given in which various attributes are given which are crucial for heart disease detection. Using the data, a model was built using auto Machine learning techniques. <br>

# What is Auto ML? <br>
Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of automating the tasks of applying machine learning to real-world problem. <br>

In this project we will first use different machine learning algorithm, then we will understand how we can use auto-ml techniques, Eval ML for this project to make the work simpler.

# Steps taken. <br>
1) Data Analysis <br>
2) Feature Engineering <br>
3) Standardization <br>
4) Model buidling <br>
5) Prediction
