The aim of this project is to predict whether a person is having a risk of heart attack or not, using automated machine learning techniques. <br>

# What is a heart attack? <br>
A heart occurs when one or more of coronary arteries becomes blocked. Overtime, a build up of fatty deposits, including cholesterol for substances called plaques, which can narrow the arteries. This condition, called coronary artery disease, causes most heart attacks. <br>
